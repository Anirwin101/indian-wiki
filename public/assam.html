        <p>Assam has a rich history that dates back to ancient times. It was ruled by the Ahom dynasty for over 600 years, which played a significant role in shaping the state's culture and traditions. The region also finds mention in ancient Indian texts like the Mahabharata.

            During the colonial period, Assam became a major center for tea production under British rule. After India's independence, Assam became a state in 1947, and its boundaries were later reorganized to form new states in the northeast.</p>
