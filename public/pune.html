        <p>Pune has a rich history, dating back to the 8th century, when it was known as Punnaka. It rose to prominence in the 17th century under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who spent his early years here and established it as a key center of the Maratha Empire. Later, in the 18th century, Pune became the headquarters of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire, making it a political and cultural hub. After the British defeated the Peshwas in 1818, Pune became an important cantonment town under British rule, with institutions like the Deccan College and Fergusson College shaping its intellectual landscape. During the freedom struggle, Pune played a vital role, with leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak leading nationalist movements. Post-independence, the city transformed into an industrial, educational, and IT hub, earning the title "Oxford of the East" due to its many prestigious institutions. Today, Pune is a dynamic city blending history with modern development.</p>
