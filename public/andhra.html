It was once a major center for trade and culture under various dynasties like the Satavahanas, Ikshvakus, Pallavas, Cholas, Kakatiyas, and Vijayanagara Empire. The Mauryan emperor Ashoka was one of the first rulers to spread Buddhism in this region, and the state is home to many ancient Buddhist sites like Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda. The Vijayanagara Empire left a significant mark on the state's history, with Lepakshi Temple being a prime example of its architectural brilliance.</p>
